"""Resolve the active palette pool from the settings + profile + inventory.

The frontend's effective-palette helper has a Python mirror here so the
upload + rerender services can snap cluster centroids against the same
pool the operator sees in the editor. Keeping both implementations in
lock-step matters for two reasons:

- the snap result lands in the persisted ``assigned_color_hex`` so the
  hash + the G-code prompt agree with what the operator picked;
- the inventory store is the single source of truth — drifting between
  the UI's view and the backend's would surface as "I picked union but
  the prompt asks for a pen I uninstalled" bugs.

Resolution rule matches ``frontend/src/lib/effectivePalette.ts``:

- ``pens``      → installed pen hexes only
- ``available`` → available-colours inventory only
- ``union``     → pens first (machine reality wins on tie-break),
                  inventory extras appended, dedup is case-insensitive
